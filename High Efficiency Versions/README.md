This code is not particularly clean, but it would serve as a great jumping off point for other projects.
All of the implentations here use diffuse lighting with soft shadows unlike the JavaScript version.
I've also included a make file, but it will probably have to be modified depending on your setup, especially if you want to run the cuda implementation.
